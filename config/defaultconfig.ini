# Config file
# ===========
#    Testing on a LOCAL network
#        Setting Network to LOCAL will inform the code what you 
#        are doing.  At some point we can be smarter.        
#
#        create a directory in your home folder called .pegnet
#
#        copy this default configuration to that directory
#
#        If you are running a multiple miners, then you can update this config
#        and be happy.
#
#        Note that the ECAddress and FCTAddress are those from the local network
#        and must be replaced with yours for the public network.
#
#        Also note that the APILayerKey is bogus.  Must be replaced with yours.
#
#    Testing on MAIN
#        Make sure your ECAddress is funded.  
#
#        If you want the code to auto buy ECs for you, then give it a FCT address
#        that has a balance and that is controlled by factom-walletd 
#
#        create a directory in your home folder called .pegnet
#       
#        copy this default configuration to that directory
#
#        If you are running multiple miners, then you can update this config
#        and be happy.
#
#    Address conversions
#        Use the PegNet cli (pncli) to convert FCT addresses to PegNet Addresses
#
#        Run pncli without parameters to get commands.  Run pncli help <cmd> for
#        help on a particular command
